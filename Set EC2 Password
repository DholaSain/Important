Using password authentication for SSH instead of key-based authentication is generally not recommended due to security reasons, as it exposes the server to potential brute force attacks. However, if you wish to enable password authentication on your EC2 instance, here are the steps you need to follow:

1. **Connect to your EC2 Instance**
First, use your existing key pair to SSH into your EC2 instance using the following command:

```bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
```

2. **Set a Password for the User**
Once you're connected, you can set a password for the user (e.g., `ec2-user` or `ubuntu`) with the `passwd` command:

```bash
sudo passwd ec2-user
```

You will be prompted to enter and confirm a new password. Make sure to choose a strong password.

3. **Update SSH Configuration**
Next, you'll need to edit the SSH daemon configuration file to enable password authentication.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

Look for the following lines and modify them if necessary:

```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

Change it to:

```
PasswordAuthentication yes
```

Additionally, ensure that `ChallengeResponseAuthentication` is set to `yes`:

```
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
```

4. **Restart SSH Service**
After saving and closing the configuration file, you need to restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

or, on older systems, you might use:

```bash
sudo service ssh restart
```

5. **Update Security Group**
Ensure your EC2 instance's Security Group allows SSH access (port 22) from your IP address or from the IP range you wish to allow.

6. **Connect Using Password**
You can now use SSH with a password by simply typing the SSH command without the `-i` option:

```bash
ssh ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
```

Once prompted, enter the password you have just set.

**Important Security Notes:**
- Make sure to use a strong password for the user account.
- Monitor the system for unauthorized access attempts.
- Consider setting up fail2ban or similar tools to ban IPs after consecutive failed login attempts.
- If you're not using the key-based authentication, it's recommended to disable root login and implement additional security mechanisms.

Keep in mind, it is generally a best practice to use SSH keys for authentication due to the security benefits they provide over password logins. If this configuration is for a production environment, seriously consider the risks and best practices for securing your server.
